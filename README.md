# Account UI for Meteor, Angular(2+) and Angular Material


## Installation

This module is compatible with this project : [Urigo/angular2-meteor-accounts-ui](https://github.com/Urigo/angular2-meteor-accounts-ui)

I have added compatibility with Angular-Material

You can install it with this tutorial : [Socially - Users & Authentication](https://angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular2/users-and-authentication)

The use is now exactly same but you need install with this command :

```
npm i angular2-material-meteor-accounts-ui
```
